	"Oh, sorry. Could you throw that away for me?",
	"Oh, is this the latest currency trend? Garbage is the new Crypto Nyan-coin?",
	"I didn't know I could deposit my trash here, can I also get a compost account?",
	"I see the bank is really cutting costs, I guess I'll have to use this as toilet paper.",
	"Wow, talk about a trashy bank...literally.",
	"This is great! Now I can finally pay off my debts with something that's worth even less than money.",
	"I appreciate the thought, but I already have enough garbage in my life.",
	"Thanks, now I have something to feed to my pet raccoon.",
	"I thought the bank was supposed to help me clean up my finances, not add to the mess.",
	"I'm pretty sure I can't use this to buy my morning coffee, but I'll try anyway.",
	"This must be some sort of new recycling initiative...thanks for the fancy paperweight!",
	"I think I'll frame this and hang it on my wall. It'll be a constant reminder of my financial decisions.",
	"Well, I guess I should be grateful. At least this garbage won't depreciate in value like money does.",
	"Thanks for the gift, but I prefer my garbage in a more eco-friendly wrapping.",
